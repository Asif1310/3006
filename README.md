Let me admit that connecting LinkedIn to a Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE) was nothing less than a convoluted process.

One needed to import Selenium and Beautiful soup and write a whole lot of code to achieve the integration.

And then, naas.ai happened.

naas (notebooks as a service) provides easy-to-use, low code notebook templates to perform several functions within a heartbeat.
Achieving the LinkedIn integration with the Jupyter Notebook was one among them.

I shamelessly piggybacked on naas.ai's template to complete my little fun project of building a word cloud out of my LinkedIn posts!
